# hello-world
Learning to use Git; newb;

Angela here, currently taking a few online classes through Udmey, and also a #GrowWithGoogle FrontEnd- Web- Developer challange scholarship recipient.
So far I am enjoying coding, and looking forward to the next challanges, rather it be with learning more Code-Monkey Front-End or Data Science/ Analytics. 
Either way this is all facinating and I'm almost dissapointed in myself that I didn't try it out earlier!
